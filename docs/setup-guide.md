## Prerequisites

To connect your SingleStore database to Fivetran, you need:

- A SingleStore instance of version 8.7.16 or higher. Refer
  to [Creating and Using Workspaces](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/getting-started-with-singlestore-helios/about-workspaces/creating-and-using-workspaces/)
  for instructions on creating a SingleStore workspace in
  the [Cloud Portal](https://portal.singlestore.com/).
  To deploy a Self-Managed cluster instead, refer
  to [Deploy](https://docs.singlestore.com/db/latest/deploy/). Once the SingleStore
  workspace/cluster is Active, you'll need the following to connect to Fivetran:
    - `Host`
    - `Port`
    - `Username`
    - `Password`
    - `Database`
    - `Table`
- A Fivetran account with
  the [Connector Creator](/docs/using-fivetran/fivetran-dashboard/account-management/role-based-access-control#rbacpermissions)
  permissions.

## Setup instructions

To authorize Fivetran to connect to your SinlgeStore database, follow these instructions:

### <span class="step-item">Configure SingleStore</span>

1. Configure your firewall and/or other access control systems to allow incoming connections to your
   SingleStore instance from [Fivetran's IPs](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/ips) for your
   region.
2. Ensure that the SingleStore database user has the `SELECT` permission.
3. Enable support of OBSERVE queries

```
SET GLOBAL enable_observe_queries=1
```

4. (Optional) Configure `snapshots_to_keep`
   and `snapshot_trigger_size` [engine variables](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/reference/configuration-reference/engine-variables/list-of-engine-variables/).
   At some point, `offsets` will be considered stale, meaning the connector will no longer be able
   to retrieve data associated with that logical point in the WAL (Write-Ahead Log). In practical
   terms, `offsets` become stale once they are older than the oldest snapshot in the system.
   The `snapshots_to_keep` and `snapshot_trigger_size` variables control the number and size of
   snapshots providing you with some control over the data retention window. If you
   increase `snapshots_to_keep` or `snapshot_trigger_size`, offsets will become stale later. If
   offsets become stale, the connector will be unable to continue streaming change events, and the
   only way to resolve this is to re-sync all data.

```
SET GLOBAL snapshot_trigger_size=10737418240
SET GLOBAL snapshots_to_keep=4
```

### <span class="step-item">Finish Fivetran configuration </span>

1. Log in to your Fivetran account.
2. Go to the [**Connectors** page](https://fivetran.com/dashboard/connectors), and then click *
   *+ Add connector**.
3. Select **SingleStore** as the connector type.
4. Enter the following connection configurations for you SingleStore workspace/cluster:
    * **Host**
    * **Port**
    * **Database**
    * **Table**
    * **Username**
    * **Password**
5. (Optional) Enable SSL and specify related configurations.
6. (Optional) Specify additional **Driver Parameters**. Refer
   to [The SingleStore JDBC Driver](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/developer-resources/connect-with-application-development-tools/connect-with-java-jdbc/the-singlestore-jdbc-driver/#connection-string-parameters)
   documentation for a list of supported parameters.
7. Click **Save & Test**.

### Setup tests

Fivetran performs the following SingleStore connection tests:

- The Connection test checks if Fivetran can connect to your SingleStore cluster using credentials
  provided in the setup form
- The Table test checks if specified table exists

### <span class="step-item">Post setup changes (Optional)</span>

We recommend to adjust the sync frequency in Fivetran so that syncs run more often. This will reduce
the likelihood of `offsets` becoming stale and help avoid the need for a full re-sync.

1. Click on `Setup`
2. Change `Sync frequency` to `15 minutes`
